Final project for Principles of Engineering Fall 2019

This repo contains code for our android app as well as the matching Arduino code. The app is called final_app. The two seperate pieces are also in the repo. The bluetooth functionality is under NewBT, and the app functionality is under Maps3.zip. All of the arduino code is under the arduino folder.

In order to run our code, download the files mentioned above and use Android Studio to upload the app onto your Android phone. Use Arduino's software to upload our code onto your Arduino. 

If you want to learn how our code works, download it and read through. It's commented so that you can understand what each section is doing.
